This directory contains the different equations of state that are
released with CASTRO:

1) gamma_law_general:

   A general gamma-law EOS.  This computes the mean molecular
   weight from the mass fractions and the species properties defined
   in the network module.  

   NOTE: the entropy is currently only correct for a monatomic gas
   (gamma = 5/3).  A more general expression (than the Sackur-Tetrode
   equation) is needed for an arbitrary constant-gamma gas.

2) helmeos:
   
   Frank Timmes' general stellar EOS.  This is modified from the
   publically available version (although the changes should not
   affect the results).  The major changes are related to
   thread-safety.  The common blocks no longer pass the state to/from
   the EOS, instead we use the argument list.

3) polytrope:

   The EOS for a polytropic fluid. The proportionality constant and
   gamma exponent can either be specified by the user in the extern
   namelist, or select one of the predefined types.

4) multigamma

   The multigamma EOS allows each fluid to specify their own gamma.
   Each species acts as an ideal gas.
