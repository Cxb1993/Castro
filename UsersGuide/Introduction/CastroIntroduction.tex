Welcome to the CASTRO User's Guide!\\ \\

In this User's Guide we describe how to download and run CASTRO, a massively parallel code 
that solves the multicomponent compressible hydrodynamic equations for 
astrophysical flows including self-gravity, nuclear reactions and radiation.
CASTRO uses an Eulerian grid and incorporates adaptive mesh refinement (AMR).
Our approach to AMR uses a nested hierarchy of logically-rectangular grids with
simultaneous refinement in both space and time. \\  \\

For more information about CASTRO, including the first two papers (published in ApJ) that describe
CASTRO with and without the radiation solvers, please visit the CCSE web site, at \\ \\
